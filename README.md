# Styled Baseline

This is just a demo of a baseline-grid, typesetting algorithm, inspired by the basekick algorithm of [braid design system](https://github.com/seek-oss/braid-design-system) with correct rendering calculations and a more typographically idiomatic API.

*Note: Get in touch if you'like this stuff, i'm also working on a framework and i really need to bounce ideas and get feedback from engineers, designers and master typographers.*
